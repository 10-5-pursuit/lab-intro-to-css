      I have a multitude of interest and have been structuring my focus on design and will continue to develop my back-end problem solving capabilities no matter the difficulty for clarity sense and understanding. Fun fact about me is I'm obsessed with marvel and my favorite character out of all of them is Storm, Birth Name: <em>Ororo Munroe</em>, who is capable of manipulating the weather.

      <h3>Hardest Bug So Far</h3>
      <p>
       The hardest bug so far was definitely trying to implement these animation elements to function properly and within proper ranges. The positioning aspect of the percentages and still trying to understand how everything still functions and what it does exactly. 
      </p>
      <p>I came up with a totally sick solution though by doing understanding how keyframes work and the way background-size can change the dimensions to improve the transitions of the colors and incorporating it cohesively. </p>
